# The Singularity - AI Intelligence Framework

A unified, autonomous AI-powered intelligence framework for criminal network analysis and investigation.

## Features

- **Unified System**: Single entry point via `python3 main.py`
- **AI-Powered**: Autonomous strategy generation and pattern recognition
- **Multi-Language**: Python (AI/ML), Go (networking), Rust (data analysis)
- **Stealth Operations**: Tor integration, proxy rotation, packet monitoring
- **Professional Reports**: Comprehensive analysis with chain of custody

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup the framework
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Run The Singularity
python3 main.py
```

## Usage

```
[S!NGUL4RITY] > investigate john.doe@example.com
[S!NGUL4RITY] > investigate +1234567890
[S!NGUL4RITY] > investigate username123
[S!NGUL4RITY] > investigate "John Doe"
[S!NGUL4RITY] > exit
```
